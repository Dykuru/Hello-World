	<h2>About Me</h2> 
	<p>Hello everyone I'm currently taking what is hopefully my last semester for my associates in CIS this year. I live in Fontana and just turned 23 a few months ago. Not my first time
	taking a class from this Professor and I hope to have a good time. I mostly play games, run, and draw in my free time but I've recently taken to making in-game sprites and coding mods for a few games
	as a hobby. I orginally struggled with HTML but have since gotten the hang of it fairly well and I hope to learn Java this time around. Currently I need to replace some parts for my laptop namely the 
	and fan sometime soon since it's getting rather old.</p>
